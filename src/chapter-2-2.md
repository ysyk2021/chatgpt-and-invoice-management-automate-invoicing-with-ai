In this chapter, we will explore the different types of invoices that businesses may use in their invoicing processes.

Standard Invoices
-----------------

Standard invoices are the most common type of invoice used by businesses. They typically include information such as the customer's name and address, a description of the goods or services provided, and the total amount due. Standard invoices are used for one-time transactions.

Recurring Invoices
------------------

Recurring invoices are used for regular payments, such as monthly subscriptions or ongoing services. These invoices can be automated to save time and effort. They typically include the same information as standard invoices but are sent out on a recurring basis.

Proforma Invoices
-----------------

Proforma invoices are used to provide customers with an estimated cost of goods or services. They are not legally binding and do not require payment. Proforma invoices are often used in international trade to provide customers with an estimate of the costs associated with importing goods.

Commercial Invoices
-------------------

Commercial invoices are used for cross-border transactions and include information about the goods being shipped. They are required for customs clearance and must include information such as the country of origin, description of the goods, and value of the shipment.

Credit Memos
------------

Credit memos are used to adjust previously issued invoices, such as in cases of returned goods or overpayments. They typically include the same information as standard invoices but reflect negative amounts.
