Definition of Invoice Management

Invoice management refers to the processes involved in creating, processing, and tracking invoices. This includes tasks such as data entry, invoice generation, payment processing, and dispute resolution.

An effective invoicing process ensures that businesses get paid accurately and on time, while also creating a positive experience for customers.

Different Types of Invoices

There are several different types of invoices that businesses may use, including:

### Standard Invoices

Standard invoices are the most common type of invoice used by businesses. They typically include information such as the customer's name and address, a description of the goods or services provided, and the total amount due.

### Recurring Invoices

Recurring invoices are used for regular payments, such as monthly subscriptions or ongoing services. These invoices can be automated to save time and effort.

### Proforma Invoices

Proforma invoices are used to provide customers with an estimated cost of goods or services. They are not legally binding and do not require payment.

### Credit Memos

Credit memos are used to adjust previously issued invoices, such as in cases of returned goods or overpayments.
